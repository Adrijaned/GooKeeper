# GooKeeper

## What is the module about?
GooKeeper is a new gameplay module, designed by SuperSnark, which is closely related to the game "Slime Rancher". Here, the player is left in the GooWorld, and he has to earn a living by catching different gooeys, and building a GooZoo! He can also make the gooeys mate with one another to produce new and interesting gooeys and nurture all of them. Attract more customers, earn more profit and then spend it on upgrading the equipment/zoo.

## Playthroughs!
